# COVID-19-EDA

### An Exploratory Data Analysis on Covid-19 Dataset

Link to Dataset : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Two tables that I have used in this project are CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.

The queries used in the projects are:
1) Total Cases vs Total Deaths
2) Total Cases vs Population
3) Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
4) Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
5) Showing contintents with the highest death count per population
6) GLOBAL NUMBERS
7) Total Population vs Vaccinations
8) Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
9) Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
10) Creating View to store data for later visualizations
